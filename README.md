# Arkanoid Game (Java OOP)

## Overview
This project is a Java implementation of the classic Arkanoid game, focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. Arkanoid is a brick-breaking game where the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and destroy bricks.

## Features
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Implemented using a GUI package for interactive gameplay.
- **Game Mechanics:** Includes paddle movement, ball bouncing, and brick destruction.
- **Levels:** Multiple levels with increasing difficulty, each featuring unique layouts of bricks.
- **Score Tracking:** Records and displays the player's score throughout the game.
- **Collision Detection:** Handles collisions between the ball, paddle, and bricks accurately.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Eliaddr119/OOP-Arkanoid-Game-.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## How to Play
1. Launch the game.
2. Use the arrow keys (or mouse) to move the paddle horizontally.
3. Keep the ball bouncing and destroy all the bricks in each level.
4. Avoid letting the ball fall below the paddle to maintain lives.
5. Progress through multiple levels by clearing all bricks.
6. Press 'P' to pause the game and space to continue.
